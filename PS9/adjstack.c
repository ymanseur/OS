/*adjstack takes a stack which is bounded by addresses lim0 and lim1
 *and adjusts the saved frame pointers (ebp/rbp) by adj bytes.
 *It is intended to be used in conjunction with sched_fork to fix
 *the child's stack, and should be called from the parent task, after
 *having allocated the child's stack and copying into it the contents of
 *the entire parent's stack.  There are some debugging fprintfs that
 *could be commented out if needed.  This will work with either 32 or 64
 *bit code since the C compiler will adjust its notion of the size of a 
 *pointer accordingly.  The parameter adj is added to each of the saved
 *base pointers in the stack frame chain, so it should be set to the difference
 *between the original stack and the new stack
